2.0.3:
- Fixed the player's body temperature sometimes resetting when exiting the world
- Addressed a minor issue related to configs resetting when changing some settings (please delete the main.toml config file)
- Addressed an issue with capabilities that caused incompatibilities with some mods
- Different kinds of ice now affect temperature accordingly
- Improved Hearth spreading algorithm (takes solid sides of blocks like stairs into account better)
- The Boiler now glows when it has fuel
- Soul Fire and Soul Campfires now cool down the player and no longer damage entities
- Made the Nether slightly hotter by default (this will not override existing configs)
- Fixed Serene Seasons being applied in dimensions where it shouldn't
- Fixed "time of day" affecting temperature in dimensions where time doesn't exist
- Instead of going to 150, the player's temperature will now visually max out at 100
    - After 100, the readout will begin to glow as the critical temperature builds up further
    - Mechanically, it still works the same
- Ambient temperature no longer affects players in creative mode
- Fixed minor bug that would occasionally cause the ambient temperature to jitter
- Added a Russian translation courtesy of Xemay on our Discord server

2.0.3.1
- Fixed a bug that caused Cold Sweat to spam errors into the console in some cases
- Rebalanced temperature-emitting blocks to have a limited effect

2.1
- Updated the Hearth's texture slightly
- The Hearth now only consumes the necessary fuel to function
    - If it is hot, for example, it will only use cold fuel
    - The Hearth will not use any fuel if there are no players in the area
- Limited the number of total blocks the Hearth can affect to 2000
- New Item: Soulfire Lamp
    - Cools the player down when in the Nether
    - Requires Warped or Crimson stems as fuel

- Technical Changes:
    - Added new events for compat mod developers to hook into:
        - TempModifierEvent.Add
            - Called when a TempModifier modifier is added to a player
            - Cancellable
            - Allows for changing arguments, enabling/disabling duplicates, and changing the modifier type
        - TempModifierEvent.Remove
            - Called when a TempModifier is removed from a player
            - Cancellable
        - TempModifierEvent.Init
            - Called when the registry of TempModifiers or BlockEffects is being built
            - Allows for injection of custom TempModifiers and BlockEffects
            - If you call this event manually, use TempModifierRegistries/BlockEffectRegistries.getEntries().flush() to prevent duplicate entries



TO-DO
- Added screen effects when the player is hot or cold, helped in large part by Softi on our Discord server
