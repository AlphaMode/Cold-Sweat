------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Beta 1
- New Item: Soulfire Lamp
    - Cools the player down when in the Nether
    - Requires Warped or Crimson stems as fuel (temporarily; will be changed to a custom item in the future)
- The Hearth now only consumes the necessary fuel to function
    - If it is hot, for example, it will only use cold fuel
    - The Hearth will not use any fuel if there are no players in the area
    - If the temperature in the area is habitable, the Hearth will not use any fuel
- Limited the number of total blocks the Hearth can affect to 2000
    - This replaces the 20-block radius that it used to have
    - increased the technical radius to 64 blocks
    - (note that it can't actually fill the entire 64-block radius, but it can reach these distances if you make a tunnel for the hearth to spread through)
- Leather armor now insulates based on what piece of armor it is (configurable)
    - i.e. a leather chestplate insulates more than a leather helmet
- Updated the Hearth's texture slightly
- Added Polish translation by @Lifus_Crustus on our Discord server
- Added Portuguese translation by @Joymachs and @Vellar on our Discord server
- Fixed multiple bugs with the Hearth that would cause it to not detect ceilings or solid blocks properly

            - Called when the registry of TempModifiers or BlockEffects is being built
            - Allows for injection of custom TempModifiers and BlockEffects
            - If you call this event manually, use getPool().flush() beforehand to prevent duplicate entries (lag)
    - The Hearth now uses the capability system instead of NBT
            - This should increase performance and prevent issues with the NBT data limit on some servers
    - "fuel_items.toml" config file changes:
        - Renamed to "item_settings.toml" to better indicate that it also includes insulation items
        - Insulation items (for the sewing table) and armor items with innate insulation are now defined separately

        - PlayerTemp.forEachModifier():
            - Calls the given function for each modifier of the given type
    - Changed how PlayerTemp.removeModifier() works
        - Instead of removing all modifiers of the given class, it takes a predicate which determines which modifiers to remove
    - Added new method for TempModifierEvent.Add: setModifier()

    - Renamed LeatherTempModifier to InsulationTempModifier
    - Added new event for compat mod developers to hook into:
        - TempModifierEvent.Tick
            - Fired when a TempModifier's value is called
            - Has two phases:
                - Pre: Called before getValue() is called
                    - Cancellable (Modifier will be skipped)
                - Post: Called after getValue() is called
    - When creating TempModifiers, override the getValue() method now instead of calculate()
        - Calculate is still used when referencing the modifier's value, but it also posts to TempModifierEvent.Tick
    - Replaced all temperature unit conversion methods with on method: MathHelperCS.convertUnits()
        - arguments: (double) value: a double representing the temperature to convert
                     (Unit) from: the unit to convert from (Unit is a new enum in net.momostudios.util)
                     (Unit) to: the unit to convert to
                     (boolean) absolute: if true, the offset of world temperature is taken into account (for example, adds 32 degrees when converting Minecraft to Fahrenheit)

        - It now must have over 3/4 of an item's fuel value missing to consume fuel
    - Now plays a sound when it runs out of the needed fuel type
    - The Hearth's code is now up to 800x more efficient (~20,000-40,000ms -> ~50-200ms of lag over 60 seconds)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.1
- Changed the recipe of the Soulfire Lamp to require a golden nugget at the top
- Revised the icons for all three potion effects (some more than others)
- The Icebox now has much clearer visual indication for when it has fuel (new particles / texture)
- The end is now slightly warmer (it's still uninhabitable, but you can stay there a lot longer now)
- Custom particles now respect the player's particle settings ("minimal" setting disables all custom particles)
- You no longer have to sneak to equip a minecart with insulation

- Added Chinese translation courtesy of 6371peter on GitHub

Fixes:
- Fixed shift-clicking items in a GUI not working or crashing in some cases
- Fixed the Soulfire Lamp & Waterskins "bobbing" randomly when held
- Fixed HUD-related crash that occurred in some rare scenarios
- Fixed beds restoring the player's temperature without actually sleeping in it

Technical Changes:
- The Hearth no longer gives Insulation to players in habitable areas
- The Hearth now uses block bounding box shape for spread detection (much more reliable)
- Rebalanced block temperatures to have differing areas of effect


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.2
- The Soulfire Lamp is now the Hellspring Lamp
      - Nothing serious has changed, but this rework brings it into closer parity with its crafting recipe
      - The ID has changed, but don't worry! Old worlds should update to the new ID automatically
      - Translation keys have changed, meaning its name will default to "Hellspring Lamp" in all languages
- Lowered the rate at which the Hearth consumes fuel
- Added compatibility for Better Weather
- The world temperature gauge now smooths out transitions on a per-frame basis instead of per-tick
      - This basically just makes it smoother for higher framerates

Fixes:
- Fixed major underlying bug with armor insulation that made it not work properly
- Fixed crash that occurs when the Hearth is near an unloaded chunk


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.3
- The effects of temperature-emitting are now blocked if there are solid blocks in the way
- Added config option to insulate all non-living rideable entities (so you would be insulated inside a modded plane, for example)
- Rebalanced a lot of Overworld biome temperatures (requires deleting world-temperatures.toml)
- Translation improvements:
      - Some elements of the config GUI will now move around/stretch to accommodate longer words
      - Removed a lot of repetitive translation keys & cleaned them up, making translating much easier (we've updated all existing languages)
      - Fixed some outdated translation keys (Russian, Polish)
      - Fixed some things in the config GUI not updating after changing the language (like ON/OFF labels)
- Added the ability to right-click fuel items into the Boiler, Icebox, and Hearth right from your hand
- Going into caves will now have a much more smooth/noticeable effect on temperature thanks to a much smarter (and more efficient) algorithm
      - The amount of temperature-dampening depends on how far you are from an opening to the surface (natural light) and your y level (deeper is better)
      - As a result of this new system, shade (kind of) helps against extreme temperatures
- It is now possible to add temperature-affecting blocks via configs

Fixes:
- Fixed insulated minecarts dropping Minecart Insulation upon loading the world, allowing for duplication

Technical Changes:
- TempModifiers can now be queued to expire automatically by calling TempModifier#expire(int ticks) when adding it to the player

- PlayerTemp and all its methods have been removed (deprecated since 2.1.3). Use PlayerHelper instead.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.9-b01
- Updated to 1.18.1
- Updated the Hearth's model, texture, item, etc. to look more "primitive" and less like a modern machine
- Tweaked Waterskins to show more realistic temperatures when filled
- Inserting fuel into the Hellspring Lamp is now handled by mixins to prevent client having power over the server
    - The client was possibly able to "spawn in" a fake fuel item, then insert it into the lantern, and the server would accept it

Fixes:
- Waterskins now properly sample the biome's temperature when being filled (this has been broken since at least 2.1)
- Fixed Minecart Insulation being consumed when right-clicking a minecart with insulation already applied

Technical Changes:
- The Hearth no longer uses the capability system (shouldn't impact anything in-game)
- Many of the utility classes have been re-worked or removed. This will require compat mods to be updated.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.9-b02
- Fixed crash caused by Serene Seasons


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.9-b03
- Fixed various crashes that would occur during server startup
- Fixed a rare crash that would occur when a block was removed in the world
- Fixed bug that caused the Sewing GUI to pull its title from the wrong translation key


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.9-b04

- Changed how Cold Sweat rearranges the hotbar to make it more compatible with mods that also change the hotbar
- Updated Hearth and empty Waterskin item textures to be more distinctive
- Increased the effective range of the Hellspring Lamp by 1.5 blocks (hopefully it's easier to share now!)

Fixes:

- Fixed "Arrow of Ice Resistance" not having a translation key
- Fixed biomes that don't exist anymore appearing in world-temperatures.toml
- Fixed potential bug that could cause problems with multiple Hearths in the world
- Fixed buggy behavior when walking through soul fire
- Fixed references to "soulfire_lamp" in some files/filenames
- Fixed some TempModifiers triggering every tick when they shouldn't on the clientside
- Fixed TempModifiers ticking on the clientside when the game is paused

Technical Changes:
- All Temperature-related classes have been moved to a new "api" package (including TempModifiers, BlockEffects, etc.)
- Custom events have been moved to the "api" package as well
- Two new Temperature types have been added:
    - HOTTEST: Controls the maximum bearable temperature for the entity
    - COLDEST: Controls the minimum bearable temperature for the entity
    - These are an offset applied to their respective values in the config
    - Can be affected by TempModifiers, manipulated using PlayerHelper, etc.
- BlockEffects can now define which blocks they are attached to in the class's constructor instead of using hasBlock()
    - Please use this when possible, as it is dramatically faster


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.9-b05
- The body temperature indicator now smoothly blends between stages (because it looks cool)
- Soul fire now gives you the powder snow freezing effect when you stand in it, making it deadly again

Fixes:
- Fixed a bug that prevented body temperature from working properly
- Fixed Soulfire not cooling down the surrounding area
- Fixed the item name hotbar overlay interfering with other UI elements
- Fixed some elements in the config menu not moving to accommodate longer strings of text

Technical Changes:
- Renamed PlayerHelper to TempHelper
      - All non-temperature-related methods have been moved from TempHelper to a new PlayerHelper class
- Events and methods for registering TempModifiers and BlockEffects have been moved/renamed to make it more intuitive
- TempModifier arguments can now be cast in a cleaner way with type arguments
      - ex: this.<Double>getArgument("my_argument") casts the returned argument to a double (CANNOT cast to primitives)
      - Because of this, the old getArgument(String id, Class clazz) method has been removed
      - This should also clear up a lot of issues with using primitives vs. classes (i.e. int vs. Integer)
- When registering TempModifiers/BlockEffects, the event is automatically wrapped in a try/catch block that alerts the user that registration has failed


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.10-b01
- Backported as much content as possible from 1.18.x to 1.16.5
- Players can no longer sleep when their body temperature or the world's temperature is deadly

- Ice Resistance now prevents damage from powder snow

Translation:
- Updated Korean translation (thanks to PixelVoxel)
- Updated Russian translation (thanks to Xemay)
- The new config tooltips have new corresponding translation keys
- Messages that show when the player is prevented from sleeping have their own translation keys

Fixes:
- Fixed custom particles rendering incorrectly (1.18.x)
- Fixed issue that caused players' world temperatures to be "linked" in multiplayer
- Fixed crash that would occur when loading/unloading chunks (1.16.5)
- Fixed special minecarts duplicating their contents (i.e. hopper minecarts duplicating hoppers)

Technical Changes:
- Backend parity between versions (especially for API-related things)
- Moved some BlockEffects to the config (ice, fire, magma blocks, and some others)
- Renamed HOTTEST and COLDEST temperature types to simply "MAX" and "MIN"
- Moved MixinWorld (1.16.5)/MixinLevel (1.18.x) to Forge event system (might help with problems importing Cold Sweat into a workspace)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.10-b02
- The player's hand is now rendered in 1st person when holding the Hellspring Lamp
- The Hellspring Lamp now works a bit differently:
      - Instead of decreasing the world's temperature, it now increases the maximum habitable temperature to  ~135 by default
      - No longer consumes more fuel in hotter areas

Fixes:
- Fixed crash when launching server
- Fixed abnormal lag caused by temperature-emitting blocks
- Fixed some items in the config menu smearing when changing window size
- Fixed Hellspring Lamp increasing world temperature
- Fixed Hearth/Boiler/Icebox not saving items when being unloaded or when the world is closed

- Fixed players not being able to return from the End
- Fixed Cold Sweat messing with UI elements from other mods
- Fixed TempModifiers sometimes being stored in NBT incorrectly
- Fixed used Waterskins not stacking correctly
- Fixed beds not exploding when used in the Nether

Technical Changes:
- Inserting fuel into the Hellspring Lamp is now handled by mixins to prevent client having power over the server (1.16.5)
    - The client was possibly able to spawn in a fake fuel item, then insert it into the lamp and the server would accept it
- Improved client-server temperature syncing
      - Temperature is now only synced when there is an update, instead of every other tick
      - Player body temperature is now synced less often, and it is smoothed out on the clientside to account for this
      - Temperature can no longer be manually synced using setTemperature() or addTemperature() because of this system


TO-DO
- Added screen effects when the player is hot or cold, helped in large part by Softi on our Discord server
