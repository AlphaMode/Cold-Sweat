2.0.3:
- Fixed the player's body temperature sometimes resetting when exiting the world
- Addressed a minor issue related to configs resetting when changing some settings (please delete the main.toml config file)
- Addressed an issue with capabilities that caused incompatibilities with some mods
- Different kinds of ice now affect temperature accordingly
- Improved Hearth spreading algorithm (takes solid sides of blocks like stairs into account better)
- The Boiler now glows when it has fuel
- Soul Fire and Soul Campfires now cool down the player and no longer damage entities
- Made the Nether slightly hotter by default (this will not override existing configs)
- Fixed Serene Seasons being applied in dimensions where it shouldn't
- Fixed "time of day" affecting temperature in dimensions where time doesn't exist
- Instead of going to 150, the player's temperature will now visually max out at 100
    - After 100, the readout will begin to glow as the critical temperature builds up further
    - Mechanically, it still works the same
- Ambient temperature no longer affects players in creative mode
- Fixed minor bug that would occasionally cause the ambient temperature to jitter
- Added a Russian translation courtesy of @Xemay on our Discord server

2.0.3.1
- Fixed a bug that caused Cold Sweat to spam errors into the console in some cases
- Rebalanced temperature-emitting blocks to have a limited effect

2.1 Beta 1
- New Item: Soulfire Lamp
    - Cools the player down when in the Nether
    - Requires Warped or Crimson stems as fuel (temporarily; will be changed to a custom item in the future)
- The Hearth now only consumes the necessary fuel to function
    - If it is hot, for example, it will only use cold fuel
    - The Hearth will not use any fuel if there are no players in the area
    - If the temperature in the area is habitable, the Hearth will not use any fuel
- Limited the number of total blocks the Hearth can affect to 2000
    - This replaces the 20-block radius that it used to have
    - increased the technical radius to 64 blocks
    - (note that it can't actually fill the entire 64-block radius, but it can reach these distances if you make a tunnel for the hearth to spread through)
- Leather armor now insulates based on what piece of armor it is (configurable)
    - i.e. a leather chestplate insulates more than a leather helmet
- Updated the Hearth's texture slightly
- Added Polish translation by @Lifus_Crustus on our Discord server
- Added Portuguese translation by @Joymachs and @Vellar on our Discord server
- Fixed multiple bugs with the Hearth that would cause it to not detect ceilings or solid blocks properly
- Fixed the /temperature command sending an incorrect message when setting another player's temperature

- Technical Changes:
    - BlockEffects and TempModifiers are now stored in a map instead of a list
        - Massive performance uplift
        - Easier to store/lookup elements by their ID/block
    - Updates to TempModifiers
        - Moved to the capabilities system
        - Much easier to add arguments
    - Added new events for compat mod developers to hook into:
        - TempModifierEvent.Add
            - Called when a TempModifier modifier is added to a player
            - Cancellable
            - Allows for changing arguments, enabling/disabling duplicates, and changing the modifier type
        - TempModifierEvent.Remove
            - Called when a TempModifier is removed from a player
            - Cancellable
            - Allows for changing the number of modifiers removed
        - TempModifierEvent.Init
            - Called when the registry of TempModifiers or BlockEffects is being built
            - Allows for injection of custom TempModifiers and BlockEffects
            - If you call this event manually, use getPool().flush() beforehand to prevent duplicate entries (lag)
    - The Hearth now uses the capability system instead of NBT
            - This should increase performance and prevent issues with the NBT data limit on some servers
    - "fuel_items.toml" config file changes:
        - Renamed to "item_settings.toml" to better indicate that it also includes insulation items
        - Insulation items (for the sewing table) and armor items with innate insulation are now defined separately
    - Added new translation keys:
        - "entity.player.damage.freeze" (The subtitle for when the player takes cold damage) (will be added next update)
        - "item.cold_sweat.soulfire_lamp" (The name of the Soulfire Lamp item)
    - Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause extreme lag when searching for temperature-affecting blocks
    - Removed some defunct recipes that would throw errors in server consoles

2.1 Beta 2
- The Soulfire Lamp no longer requires ingredients from the Nether to craft
    - Now crafted with a Heart of the Sea
    - Its texture has been updated accordingly
- The Soulfire Lamp now uses ~30% less fuel
- Water now cools you down
    - When you get out, it takes a bit of time to warm up
    - In cold biomes, the effect is greater, so be careful!
    - The speed at which you warm up also depends on the ambient temperature
- Added new sounds for when the player is freezing
- Sleeping through the night now brings your temperature closer to 0
- Using the ingame config menu on a server now changes the server's configs if the player has OP permission level 2 or higher
- Configs on the server now properly take precedence over the player's configs
- Fixed Icebox and Soul Campfire not cooling the area around them
- Fixed an issue that caused the player's temperature to not be saved properly upon leaving the world
- Fixed crash with Waterskins in the player's hotbar
- Fixed bug that prevented some modded worn items from showing on the player's model
- Fixed a bug that prevented the Hearth from spreading through some non-solid blocks
- Performance improvements & bug fixes for when the player is holding a Soulfire Lamp
- New textures for Boiler and Icebox fuel gauges

- Technical Changes:
    - Reduced the potential performance impact of wearing leather armor
        - This probably won't affect performance much, but it's worth noting (it all adds up, you know!)
    - Added new methods for handling TempModifiers:
        - PlayerTemp.hasModifier():
            - Returns true if the player has a modifier of the given type
        - PlayerTemp.forEachModifier():
            - Calls the given function for each modifier of the given type
    - Changed how PlayerTemp.removeModifier() works
        - Instead of removing all modifiers of the given class, it takes a predicate which determines which modifiers to remove
    - Added new method for TempModifierEvent.Add: setModifier()
        - Replaces the modifier that would have been added with the one given
    - Renamed LeatherTempModifier to InsulationTempModifier
    - Added new event for compat mod developers to hook into:
        - TempModifierEvent.Tick
            - Fired when a TempModifier's value is called
            - Has two phases:
                - Pre: Called before getValue() is called
                    - Cancellable (Modifier will be skipped)
                - Post: Called after getValue() is called
    - When creating TempModifiers, override the getValue() method now instead of calculate()
        - Calculate is still used when referencing the modifier's value, but it also posts to TempModifierEvent.Tick
    - Replaced all temperature unit conversion methods with on method: MathHelperCS.convertUnits()
        - arguments: double value: a double representing the temperature to convert
                     Unit from: the unit to convert from (Unit is a new enum class in net.momostudios.util)
                     Unit to: the unit to convert to
                     boolean absolute: if true, the offset of ambient temperature is taken into account (for example, adds 32 degrees when converting Minecraft to Fahrenheit)

TO-DO
- Added Italian translation courtesy of @SniperFoxy on our Discord server
- Added screen effects when the player is hot or cold, helped in large part by Softi on our Discord server
